### How to Use

3. To create a new note:
   - Click on the "Note Title" field and enter a title for your note.
   - Click on the "Note Text" field and enter the content of your note.
   - Once you've entered the title and text, a floppy disk icon will appear in the top-right corner. Click it to save your note.

4. Your saved notes will appear in the list on the left. To view a note, simply click on its title.

5. To delete a note, click the trash can icon next to the note in the list.
